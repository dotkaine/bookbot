# BookBot is my first git project!

This program scans through a file (in this case a book txt file) and prints out a report on the book. The report then contains the following:
- Number of words within the document
- Number of times a specific characters has been used

If I was to make improvements to this project I would add:
- Logic to retrieve a specific file based on user input
    - User would be able to search for a specific book and print the report
